                <h2>Some Famous Artworks</h2>
                <!-- displaying some famous artworks by great people -->
                <h3>1.Christ Carrying the Cross by El Greco (1580)</h3>
                        In total, <strong>El Greco</strong> made at least seven copies of the oil painting <em>"Christ Carrying the Cross"</em>, which testifies both to the importance of this work for the artist himself and to its incredible popularity during the artist's lifetime. <strong>El Greco</strong> focused primarily not on the divine, but on the humanity of Christ. Today, this masterpiece of art is kept at the <ins>Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York</ins>.<br>

                    <h3>2.The Tower of Babel by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1563)</h3>
                        <strong>Pieter Bruegel the Elder</strong> has created as many as three famous art pieces based on a popular biblical storyline. According to the artist's vision, it is not language barriers that are to blame for the <em>failure that befell the construction</em>, but mistakes and poor-quality building materials. At first glance, the huge structure seems strong enough, but upon closer inspection, the secret of the painting is revealed. You can see this artwork in the <ins>Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna</ins>.

                    <h3>3.The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch (1500-1510)</h3>
                        <em>The Garden of Earthly Delights</em>, the best art of all time, is the most monumental triptych by <strong>Hieronymus Bosch</strong>, painted by the artist between 1500 and 1510, currently located in the <ins>Prado Museum in Madrid</ins>. The triptych is literally overflowing with figures, fantastic constructions, monsters, caricatures of reality, which will take at least a month to examine in detail. The phantasmagoric surrealistic world created by Bosch is absolutely incompatible with any of the existing religions.

                    <h3>4.Impression, Sunrise by Claude Monet (1872)</h3> 
                        The name of this painting <em>Impression</em>, soleil levant with the light hand of the journalist <strong>L. Leroy</strong> became the name of the artistic movement. The painting was painted from life in the old outport of Le Havre in France. Today, this iconic work of the impressionist <strong> Claude Monet </strong>adorns the <ins>Mus√©e Marmottan Monet in Paris.</ins>

                        <h3>5.The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh (1889)</h3>
                        <strong>Van Gogh's</strong> <em>Starry Night</em> is one of the most most famous paintings in post-impressionist culture. It is currently on display at the <ins>Museum of Modern Art in New York</ins>. Unlike most of Dutch artist's paintings, Starry Night was painted from memory. At that time, Van Gogh was in the hospital of Saint-Remy, tormented by fits of madness.
