📝 About the Artworks
Christ Carrying the Cross: El Greco created at least seven versions of this oil painting, focusing on the humanity of Christ. This masterpiece is housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

The Tower of Babel: Pieter Bruegel the Elder's vision symbolizes failure due to mistakes and poor-quality materials, rather than language barriers. See it at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

The Garden of Earthly Delights: Hieronymus Bosch’s monumental triptych overflows with fantastical figures and surreal scenes, located at the Prado Museum, Madrid.

Impression, Sunrise: Claude Monet painted this iconic impressionist work from life in Le Havre, France. It is now at the Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris.

The Starry Night: Painted by Vincent van Gogh from memory during his stay in a hospital in Saint-Remy, this iconic piece is on display at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.
